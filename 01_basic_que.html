    <h1>Java Revision Questions and Answers</h1>

    <h2>1. Why you must learn Java</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages worldwide.</li>
            <li>It has strong community support and extensive documentation available.</li>
            <li>Java is platform-independent with its "write once, run anywhere" capability.</li>
            <li>It offers excellent job opportunities and career growth in software development.</li>
            <li>Java is versatile and used in various domains like web, mobile, enterprise applications, and big data.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>2. What is a Programming Language</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions.</li>
            <li>It is used to produce various kinds of output and create computer programs.</li>
            <li>Programming languages allow humans to communicate with computers effectively.</li>
            <li>They can be high-level (closer to human language) or low-level (closer to machine code).</li>
            <li>Examples include Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript, each with specific syntax and semantics.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>3. What is an Algorithm</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or accomplish a task.</li>
            <li>It is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions.</li>
            <li>Algorithms must be clear, unambiguous, and have a defined set of inputs and outputs.</li>
            <li>They form the foundation of computer programming and problem-solving.</li>
            <li>Examples include sorting algorithms (like QuickSort) and search algorithms (like Binary Search).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>4. What is Syntax</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure of a programming language.</li>
            <li>It determines how programs written in the language must be constructed.</li>
            <li>Syntax errors occur when code violates these rules, preventing successful compilation.</li>
            <li>Different programming languages have different syntax rules (e.g., Java uses semicolons; Python doesn't).</li>
            <li>Proper syntax is essential for code to be understood by both computers and other programmers.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>5. History of Java</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li>Originally called Oak, it was designed for interactive television but was too advanced.</li>
            <li>Renamed Java in 1995, it became popular with the rise of the internet due to its portability.</li>
            <li>Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010, who now maintains Java.</li>
            <li>Java has evolved through many versions, with Java 8 and Java 11 being significant LTS releases.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Magic of Byte Code</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Bytecode is the intermediate representation of Java code that the JVM executes.</li>
            <li>Java compiles source code into bytecode (.class files) rather than machine-specific code.</li>
            <li>This bytecode can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
            <li>Bytecode enables Java's "write once, run anywhere" capability.</li>
            <li>It provides security benefits as bytecode is verified by the JVM before execution.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>7. How Java Changed the Internet</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Java introduced applets, enabling interactive content in web browsers.</li>
            <li>Its platform independence made it ideal for diverse internet-connected devices.</li>
            <li>Java provided secure execution through the sandbox model in browsers.</li>
            <li>It became fundamental for server-side programming with Java EE (Enterprise Edition).</li>
            <li>Java's robustness and scalability made it a backbone for many web applications and services.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Java Buzzwords</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>Simple: Java was designed to be easy to learn and use.</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented: Follows OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
            <li>Platform Independent: Bytecode runs on any platform with a JVM.</li>
            <li>Secure: Features like bytecode verification and sandbox execution enhance security.</li>
            <li>Multithreaded: Supports concurrent programming with built-in thread capabilities.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>9. Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <ol>
            <li>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".</li>
            <li>Objects contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods).</li>
            <li>Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
            <li>OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.</li>
            <li>Java is fundamentally object-oriented, with everything (except primitives) being an object.</li>
        </ol>
